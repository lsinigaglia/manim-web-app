# Basic Graph Network Notes

Key patterns:
- `Graph(vertices, edges, layout=...)` creates a graph
- Access individual vertices via `graph.vertices[v]`
- Access individual edges via `graph.edges[(u, v)]`
- `layout="spring"` uses force-directed layout
- `vertex_config` and `edge_config` style all vertices/edges
